# 🔐 Smart Password Audit Tool

A powerful **Cybersecurity desktop application** built using **Python and Tkinter** that helps users analyze, audit, and improve password strength using AI-based insights, entropy analysis, breach detection, real-time feedback, encryption, and more — all in a clean graphical user interface.

## 📄 Abstract

This project focuses on evaluating and improving password security using multiple intelligent techniques. It provides feedback on password strength, potential vulnerabilities, and suggestions for improvement. It also logs password analysis, generates secure passwords, and checks if passwords have been breached before.
